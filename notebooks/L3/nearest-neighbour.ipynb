    "One commonly used GIS task is to be able to find the nearest neighbour. For instance, you might have a single Point object\n",
    "representing your home location, and then another set of locations representing e.g. public transport stops. Then, quite typical question is *\"which of the stops is closest one to my home?\"*\n",
    "This is a typical nearest neighbour analysis, where the aim is to find the closest geometry to another geometry.\n",
    "\n",
