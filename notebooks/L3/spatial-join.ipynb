    "# Spatial join\n",
    "\n",
    "[Spatial join](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Spatial_Join) is\n",
    "yet another classic GIS problem. Getting attributes from one layer and\n",
    "transferring them into another layer based on their spatial relationship\n",
    "is something you most likely need to do on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we learned how to perform **a Point in Polygon query**.\n",
    "We could now apply those techniques and create our own function to perform **a spatial join** between two layers based on their\n",
    "spatial relationship. We could, for example, join the attributes of a polygon layer into a point layer where each point would get the\n",
    "attributes of a polygon that ``contains`` the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, [spatial join is already implemented in Geopandas](http://geopandas.org/mergingdata.html#spatial-joins)\n",
    ", thus we do not need to create it ourselves. There are three possible types of\n",
    "join that can be applied in spatial join that are determined with ``op`` -parameter in the ``gpd.sjoin()`` -function:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  ``\"intersects\"``\n",
    "-  ``\"within\"``\n",
    "-  ``\"contains\"``\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds familiar? Yep, all of those spatial relationships were discussed\n",
    "in the [Point in Polygon lesson](point-in-polygon.ipynb), thus you should know how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's perform a spatial join between these two layers:\n",
    "- **Addresses:** the address-point Shapefile that we created trough geocoding \n",
    "- **Population grid:** a Polygon layer that is a 250m x 250m grid showing the amount of people living in the Helsinki Region.\n",
    "    - The population grid a dataset is produced by the **Helsinki Region Environmental\n",
    "Services Authority (HSY)** (see [this page](https://www.hsy.fi/fi/asiantuntijalle/avoindata/Sivut/AvoinData.aspx?dataID=7) to access data from different years).\n",
    "    - For this lesson we will use the population grid for year 2017, which can be dowloaded as a shapefile [from this link](https://www.hsy.fi/sites/AvoinData/AvoinData/SYT/Tietoyhteistyoyksikko/Shape%20(Esri)/V%C3%A4est%C3%B6tietoruudukko/Vaestotietoruudukko_2017_SHP.zip) in the  [Helsinki Region Infroshare\n",
