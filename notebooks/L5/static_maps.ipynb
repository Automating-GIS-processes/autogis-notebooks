    "## Adding basemap from external source\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to add a basemap to your visualization that shows e.g. streets and their names and other useful information directly underneath your visualization. This can be done easily by using ready-made background map tiles that are provided by different providers such as [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles) or [Stamen Design](http://maps.stamen.com). A Python library called [contextily](https://github.com/darribas/contextily) is a handy package that can be used to fetch geospatial raster files and add them to your maps. Map tiles are typically distributed in [Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857)](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/epsg3857-wgs84-web-mercator-auxiliary-sphere/), hence it is necessary to reproject all the spatial data into [Web Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection) before visualizing the data.\n",
