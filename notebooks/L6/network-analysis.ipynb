    "Finding a shortest path using a specific street network is a common GIS problem that has many practical\n",
    "applications. For example navigators are one of those \"every-day\" applications where **routing** using specific algorithms is used to find the optimal route between two (or multiple) points.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to perform network analysis such as tranposrtation routing in Python.\n",
    "[Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/) is a Python module that provides\n",
    "a lot tools that can be used to analyze networks on various different ways. It also contains algorithms\n",
    "such as [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.single_source_dijkstra.html#networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.single_source_dijkstra) or\n",

    "\n",
    "To be able to conduct network analysis, it is, of course, necessary to have a network that is used for the analyses. [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) package that we just explored in previous tutorial, makes it really easy to retrieve routable networks from OpenStreetMap with different transport modes (walking, cycling and driving). Osmnx also combines some functionalities from `networkx` module to make it straightforward to conduct routing along OpenStreetMap data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will test the routing functionalities of osmnx by finding a shortest path between two points based on drivable roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's first download the OSM data from Kamppi but this time include only such street segments that are walkable. In omsnx it is possible to retrieve only such streets that are drivable by specifying `'drive'` into `network_type` parameter that can be used to specify what kind of streets are retrieved from OpenStreetMap (other possibilities are `walk` and `bike`).\n"
