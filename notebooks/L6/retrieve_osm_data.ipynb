    "## What is OpenStreetMap?\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global collaborative (crowd-sourced) dataset and project that aims at creating a free editable map of the world containing a lot of information about our environment.\n",
    "It contains data for example about streets, buildings, different services, and landuse to mention a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSM has a large userbase with more than 4 million users and over a million contributers that update actively the OSM database with 3 million changesets per day. In total OSM contains more than 4 billion nodes that form the basis of the digitally mapped world that OSM provides ([stats from November 2017](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Stats)).\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap is used not only for integrating the **OSM maps** as background maps to visualizations or online maps, but also for many other purposes such as **routing**, **geocoding**, **education**, and **research**. OSM is also widely used for humanitarian response e.g. in crisis areas (e.g. after natural disasters) and for fostering economic development (see more from [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM) website](https://www.hotosm.org)).\n"

    "This week we will explore a Python module called [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx)\n",
    "that can be used to retrieve, construct, analyze, and visualize street networks from OpenStreetMap, and also retrieve data about Points of Interest such as restaurants, schools, and lots of different kind of services. It is also easy to conduct network routing based on walking, cycling or driving by combining OSMnx functionalities with a package called [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an overview of the capabilities of the package, see an introductory video given by the lead developer of the package, Prof. Geoff Boeing: [\"Meet the developer: Introduction to OSMnx package by Geoff Boeing\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0uxu25ddc4&list=PLs9D4XVqc6dCAhhvhZB7aHGD8fCeCC_6N).\n",

A DiGraph is a data type that stores nodes and edges with optional data, or attributes.
